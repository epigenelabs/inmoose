## [0.2.4]

- add a `data` module, with two RNA-Seq datasets: `pasilla` and `airway`
- fix build on readthedocs
- updated bibliography with our BMC Bioinformatics paper
- add verbose to consensus clustering computation
- add a utility class `VirtualCohortInput` to better check the well definition
  of inputs to the batch effect correction routines

## [0.2.3]

- fix syntax-impairing typos in `pyproject.toml`

## [0.2.2]

- proper documentation for the `sim` module

- batch effect correction functions now accept both `numpy` arrays and `pandas`
  dataframes as input for the counts matrix
